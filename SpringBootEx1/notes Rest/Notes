Spring Boot:
-------------
- spring boot is a flavour on the existing spring components.
-> Spring boot is open source
->Initially  Intended for micro service apps , then can be used for any spring projects.
- Spring Boot uses completely new development model to make Java Development very easy by avoiding some tedious development steps 
and boilerplate code and configuration.  
->using a stand-alone[main method]  we can manage any kind of spring projects.
> spring boot has inbuilt enabled tomcat server.
  
Audience:
----------
Java
Springs + MVC + Hibernate + DAO + Maven + web services.

 
What is Spring Boot?
------------------------------------
- It is easy to create a stand-alone and production ready spring applications using Spring Boot. 
- Spring Boot has the best infrastructure support for developing a micro service 
- enables to develop enterprise-ready applications that you can �just run�
- You can get started with minimum configurations without the need for an entire Spring configuration setup.

- while working with sping boot we dont need any server, spring boot has inbuilt tomcat server

Spring Boot  = Spring Framework + Some Embedded HTTP Servers (Tomcat/Jetty etc.) – XML or Annotations Configurations.

Here minus means we don’t need to write any XML Configuration and few Annotations only.

spring boot has embedded jar files.

features:
------------
- spring_boot_starter



Advantages
Easy to understand and develop spring applications
 - to make Java Development very easy and avoid some tedious steps.
 - to get rid of boilerplate code and configuration. [springs.xml] ==> minimum configuration.
 - easy to create a stand-alone and production ready spring application that you can just run.
 - get rid of server[tomcat] as spring boot has embedded server.
 - Increases productivity & Reduces the development time
- in pom.xml adding the spring dependencies is simplified using spring boot starter.
- Consists of a wide range of APIs for monitoring and managing applications
- 	Security and Logging 
-	Comes with Spring Boot starters to ensure dependency management
- Integrates easily with Spring JDBC, Spring ORM, Spring Data, Spring Security easily by avoiding boilerplate code.


Ways to create spring boot application?
1.	Using Spring.io initializer.
2.	Using Eclipse or any similar IDE and Maven simple project.  -> recommeneded.
3.	Using Spring Tool Suite.
4.	Using CLI.
5.	Spring Boot Project using Spring.io initializer.


Goals
To avoid complex XML configuration in Spring
To develop a production ready Spring applications in an easier way
To reduce the development time and run the application independently
Offer an easier way of getting started with the application
