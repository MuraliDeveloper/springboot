boot starter:
- its a dependency in jar file
- based on type of component we need .

Handling dependency management is a difficult task for big projects. 
Spring Boot resolves this problem by providing a set of dependencies for  developers convenience.
Boot starters:[to handle the all dependencies/jars ] - no need to write multiple <dependency> tag in pom.xml
Based on the component we are developing in our project we need to include the boot starter in pom.xml
•	spring-boot-starter: – This is the core starter and includes logging, auto-configuration support, and YAML.
•	spring-boot-starter-jdbc – This starter is used for HikariCP connection pool with JDBC
•	spring-boot-starter-web – Is the starter for building web applications, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC
•	spring-boot-starter-data-jpa – Is the starter to use Spring Data JPA with Hibernate
•	spring-boot-starter-security – Is the starter used for Spring Security
•	spring-boot-starter-aop: This starter is used for aspect-oriented programming with AspectJ and  Spring AOP
•	spring-boot-starter-test: Is the starter for testing Spring Boot applications

Spring Boot Starter Security dependency is used for Spring Security. Its code is shown below

<dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>


Spring Boot Starter web dependency is used to write a Rest Endpoints. Its code is shown below
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>

Spring Boot Starter Thyme Leaf dependency is used to create a web application. 
Its code is shown below
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf</artifactId>
</dependency>

Spring Boot Starter Test dependency is used for writing Test cases. Its code is shown below
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test<artifactId>
</dependency>

Ex:
1.spring-boot-starter-web
2.spring-boot-starter-test
3.spring-boot-starter-jpa

steps:

1.create maven project
2.add pom.xml with web as starter
3. maven build

package the jar:
----------------------
Adding Spring Boot Maven Plugin
We can include Maven plugin in our pom.xml file. 
It is used to package the project as an executable jar. We are adding it here.

<build>  
    <plugins>  
        <plugin>  
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>  
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>  
        </plugin>  
    </plugins>  
</build>
