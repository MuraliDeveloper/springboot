The @SpringBootApplicationannotation does the magic work to start the embedded Tomcat server, configure Spring Dispatcher Servlet, etc.
And there are two default directories 
and one properties file in the src/main/resources folder.

1.static: put your static files here, e.g. HTML files.
2.templates: put your template files here, e.g. ThymeLeaf files.
3.application.properties: specify additional configurations here, e.g. logging, Spring MVC view resolver, server port number, etc.


1.try http://localhost:8078/ then "index.html" will open under static


2.
We will create JSP page with JSTL to display the contact list, 
so add the following two dependencies in the pom.xml file:
The dependency tomcat-embed-jasper is JSP Engine for Tomcat. 
It is required to enable JSP with Spring Boot.


3. If you need ThymeLeaf:
remove the dependencies tomcat-embed-jasper and jstl as we canâ€™t use both JSP and ThymeLeaf.
