CrudRepository vs	JpaRepository
------------------------------------------
CrudRepository does not provide any method for pagination and sorting.	
JpaRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository. It provides all the methods for implementing the pagination.

It works as a marker interface.	
JpaRepository extends both CrudRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository.

It provides CRUD function only. For example findById(), findAll(), etc.	
It provides some extra methods along with the method of PagingAndSortingRepository and CrudRepository. For example, flush(), deleteInBatch().

It is used when we do not need the functions provided by JpaRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository.	
It is used when we want to implement pagination and sorting functionality in an application.
